As regards for the port number. If you are behind your home router you don’t need to change the port locally on your computer.

You can just forward messages received by the router on port 4343 to the port 22 of your computer (specified with the IP address). This is even better because the bots will focus only on the port 22 of your router since it is the only gateway between internet and your local network.

And by the way I recommend to only forward the necessaries ports to your local computer and not all of them. Else it could be a security issue.
