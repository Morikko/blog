Open Source is a fascinating and growing concept. But behind the promises, there are people and companies with goals. In this article, I want to share with you my representation of the open source ecosystem and how to find your place to contribute. In the end, I hope you will take the plunge and enter the great Open Source community.

### Motivation

Either you have no idea why you should do Open Source or you already decided to commit, as a contributor, your motivation is key to push you to contribute.

1.  **Learning**. You are interested in a new technology you never tried. You are looking for experiences to boost your next job interviews. You are just curious. Open Source is the right place to learn by doing on real use cases.
2.  **Solving a problem.** A useful library is bugged. A favorite application misses an interesting feature. You have a new idea for resolving a problem. With the Open Source community, you can build better solutions than alone.
3.  **Sharing with others.** You are keen on helping your fellow developers. You believe that knowledge should be for everybody. Either by providing solutions or with advice, you can push the community forward.
4.  **Looking for respect.** You want to show to yourself and to the community that you are able to succeed in some challenges. You want to impress your employer or simply you love stars.
5.  **Following the trend.** Everybody is doing Open Source so you don’t want to miss the boat. Only keep in mind that Open Source is time-consuming and requires energy.

_I used open source primarily for 2 reasons: learning and solving problems. The extension (_[_Sync Tab Groups_](https://github.com/Morikko/sync-tab-groups)_) I worked on improves your experience for managing a lot of tabs. It was a strong adventure to know how to manage a project and how to be a web developer. Learning while being_ inexperienced _is possible but at a cost. I spent a lot of time improving my previous work due to mistakes_. _Today, I start focusing more on sharing with others as I learned valuable skills._

### Choose your project

There is not only one Open Source but as many as there are projects. You can’t be involved in all the projects. And, actually, with many of them, you are not going to fit. So, you should choose them well.

#### Project Owner

It is important to know who is the project owner in order to know what to expect from this project. Open Source neither means the project is working well nor everything you want happens.

1.  **Company.** A company is behind a project and finance it with internal developers or money. Thanks to these advantages, those projects are often among the most advanced and used (open source) projects. You can think at the [Go language](https://github.com/golang/go) (Google), the [Elastic Search engine](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch) (Elastic), or the [library React](https://github.com/facebook/react`) (Facebook). The project is driven by the company needs, either business or marketing. While your idea might be good, they are going to be integrated only if it supports the company motivation.
2.  **Non-profit foundation**. You probably know the [Mozilla Foundation](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/) or the [Apache Foundation](https://www.apache.org/). Both are non-profit corporations that support many Open Source projects. Contrary to a company, they don’t have to make money, so they are freer to focus on something different. You can think of Firefox focusing more on privacy because they don’t sell your data. As the projects are often big, the development follows a roadmap with dedicated developers. They always need small hands for testing and reporting issues.
3.  **Personal project.** It is a project started by one or many developers in their free time. The projects, often with reasonable size, are easier to be involved in. Depending on the popularity, some projects are overtaken by the contributors whereas others are desperately waiting for some. As the owners are mainly volunteers, they are sometimes not available to spend enough time on the project. It is often the case when the project is done on the owners’ free time without financial compensation.
4.  **Your project.** It is also a personal project, but this time you are at the command. It might afraid, it might provide satisfaction. The power comes with responsibility as you have to make your place among all the other open source projects and among the community. It is often more time consuming than just contributing from time to time. You have to be available for the community to support your contributors.

_I started with rather big projects where I reported issues, wrote documentation and sometimes fixed small bugs. Although I liked it, with smaller projects, I felt I had a bigger impact. I ended starting my own one. I was responsible for everything but then it was hard to attract contributors. Now, I contribute to only projects I am using and where I find a bug or I have an idea. Furthermore, I always wait for the owner’s acceptance before working on it._

#### Connection with the project

Without a strong motivation and connection to the project, you might give up quickly.

1.  **Projects you are using.** You know already how to use it, and you understand what it should do. Those advantages are great to enter a project and keep the motivation all along. Once you have done something, you might use it and thus enjoy it much more.
2.  **Projects with attractive technologies.** I mean a technology you love, master or want to learn for the future.
3.  **The rest.**

_I once did an issue in a PHP project although I never code in PHP and didn’t use the solution regularly. I spent a lot of time diving in the code for very little results. The contribution was more a constraint than a pleasure. In comparison, I loved to participate in projects I used despite if most of the time it is about developer tools. Immediately, I deeper understand the problem and the solution, and once the solution is delivered, I can use it._

#### Quality of the project

-   **Responsiveness. Do** the owners respond to the messages in a decent time? Are the Pull Requests taking into account? If it is not the case, you could lose your time on a dead project. In this case, it might be worse to ask the owners to replace them. If the owners don’t answer, you could fork the project.
-   **Openness**. Is it written any contributions are welcomed? Do the owners accept other ideas? Check also the closed issues The discussions and tags inside might tell which ones are possible or already done. If you don’t fit with the mindset you won’t enjoy contributing.
-   **Contributors.** How fast contributors volunteer for an issue? Do some features be proposed only to some (known) contributors? Sometimes you might have to compete with others, don’t take it personally. Nevertheless, if you prefer a more quiet environment, just look around. Behind all the attractive projects, many others are desperately waiting for contributors.
-   **Quality**. Check the project organization. Is the code understandable? Is there any documentation? Does the software architecture make sense? A low-quality project could never succeed. Also, if you are willing to learn, you might rather learn anti-patterns than useful skills.
-   **Popularity**. Is the project used by some people? Are those people happy with it (notes, downloads, stars…)? The more the project is used, the more the community is behind to support it.

### Type of contributions

1.  **Help**. Before getting even involved in the project directly. You could start contributing by answering questions (stack-overflow) or write articles on how to use it.
2.  **Issue.** The easiest way to contribute to an Open Source project is by taking part in the issues. Either by reporting bugs or proposing new features. Furthermore, you can respond to previous issues to precise it more or provide alternative solutions.
3.  **Documentation.** Among all the issues, the documentation is the best entry point. You get familiar with the project guidelines and processes while adding value. Also, it forces you to investigate the code and logic of the project. Don’t neglect documentation, most of the users, especially for libraries, spend a lot of time in the documentation.
4.  **Fixes.** The bugs are a way to improve the project while getting more on how the code is written. Usually, you don’t have to write much new code, rather you dive deeper in the code logic.
5.  **Features.** You are developing completely new code. Depending on if it is a small change or a completely new feature, the necessary experience could change a lot.
6.  **Architecture.** A project by getting bigger and bigger might need a new design to support future changes. Although interesting, those contributions require to be very talented to not weaken the project.

For a technical approach on how to do a contribution, I recommend you to read this great article: [The beginner’s guide to contributing to a GitHub project](https://akrabat.com/the-beginners-guide-to-contributing-to-a-github-project/).

### Share your project

This section might interest you only if it is your project. First, apply the “quality” section on your project as if you were an external contributor. Would you contribute to your own project? If you don’t think so, you should better increase your project attraction.

-   **Tell explicitly you accept contributions.** In the project homepage and in the issues. For the issues, sort the ones you don’t consider or will accept a contribution.
-   **Make your project easy to set up.** Limit the manual operations and try to automatize as much as possible. A contributor that gets trouble to set up the project might run away immediately.
-   **Have clear documentation**. When a contributor discovers the project at the beginning, he is as an explorer. Being an explorer is attractive but also exhausting. By helping your contributors, they might less give up. As well, the guidelines tell your contributors what you expect from them and how they should work.
-   **Use the right technologies**. Focusing on simple, powerful and very used technologies is a good bet to attract people. Be careful with too trendy technology, it might be too complicated for your use case.
-   **Be clean.** Your project is a display of your person and your capacity. If the code is ununderstandable, the architecture makes no sense or worse not working, the contributors won’t take the effort to help you.
-   **Be available**. One of the most important criteria in my own opinion. Contributors are going to put energy in your project while they are getting responses from you. If you lack here, quickly the community moves to other more living projects.

**→ You can wait for your contributors.**

_When I developed my web extension, I primarily worked on the features and how to gain experiences. I completely neglected the project attraction and did many. The project lacked documentation, was painfully to set up and based on some poor technologies. I paid the price later on. Although many users are using the extension, the contributions narrow on reporting issues and writing translations._

### Advice

Finally, I share with you some advice to be sure to succeed in open source and let a good image for the community.

-   Communication is key
-   Respect the people
-   Be humble
-   Start small
-   Search before asking
-   Read code for progressing
