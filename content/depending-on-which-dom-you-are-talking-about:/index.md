Depending on which DOM, you are talking about:

-   The one in a web extension page -> yes
-   The one in the background page -> yes if you fetch it with browser.runtime.getBackgroundPage(), you access to the window object
-   The one in an interface page (popup, panelâ€¦) -> yes but it could be hard to put the Jasmine interface as well

If you are thinking about another DOM, I will need more information.
