Maintainers in the repository just informed, they won’t accept any more spam or low effort PRs ([https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/guides/issues/4639](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/guides/issues/4639)).

Don’t contribute only for a shirt please…

Moreover, you are just overloading maintainers of the repository. They have 2,700 PRs to review since this article has been written.

### Rules of Hacktoberfest

To get a shirt, you must make four pull requests between October 1–31 in any timezone. Pull requests can be to any public repo on GitHub, not just the ones we’ve highlighted. The pull request must contain commits you made yourself. **Pull requests reported by maintainers as spam or that are automated will be marked as invalid and won’t count towards the shirt.**
